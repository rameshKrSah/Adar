# Adar : Adversarial Activity Recognition in Wearables

This repository has the code and data for the experiments we did in our paper [Adar : Adversarial Activity 
Recognition in Wearables](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Adar%3A-Adversarial-Activity-Recognition-in-Wearables-Sah-Ghasemzadeh/2e5222171b5eb8c9dd855d7bf96bf54e661ea9a1)


# Logistics
1. To run the provided code, you need the following tools:
	1. Python 3.6.8, the latest version of Python.
	2. TensorFlow version 1.12.0
	3. Numpy, Pandas and other tools. 

The best way to get these tools is to use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)

# Execution
* To run the experiments you can either use the provided pre-trained models and processed data. To do this just run the 
Python script file **run_pretrained.py**. This will run all the experiments using the models and data provided in the 
repository and store the results in the folder **results/pretrained/**.
