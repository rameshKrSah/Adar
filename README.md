# Adar : Adversarial Activity Recognition in Wearables

This repository has the code and data for the experiments we did in our paper [Adar : Adversarial Activity 
Recognition in Wearables](http://epsl.eecs.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Adar_Adversarial_Activity_Recognition_in_Wearables_ICCAD_2019.pdf)


# Logistics
1. To run the provided code, you need the following tools:
	1. Python 3.6.8, the latest version of Python.
	2. TensorFlow version 1.12.0
	3. Numpy, Pandas and other tools. 

The best way to get these tools is to use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)

# Execution
* To run the experiments you can either use the provided pre-trained models and processed data. To do this just run the 
Python script file **run_pretrained.py**. This will run all the experiments using the models and data provided in the 
repository and store the results in the folder **results/pretrained/**.
